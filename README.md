# Introduction
This MoSoT is meant to be a practice project for us to learn about the legals, ethics and necessary security behind making software. The main goal or assignment given was: "Using a Raspberry Pi/Arduino/Software, create some kind of hacking or management-tool." 

The choice for a MoSoT came from the idea that remote/hybrid work has become bigger since COVID-19, meaning that monitoring the productivity of employees digitally has become a bigger concern for companies. We thought making a MoSoT ourself would be a good way to get familiar with the legals, ethics and necessary security within IT(-systems). Also, we think the fact multiple MoSoTs (both commercial and open source) already exist could guide us in knowing what's possible, what's allowed and how it could be done.
